description of the file:

linearprobing.cpp
    the implementation of the algorithm for linear probing
doublehashing.cpp
    the implementation of the algorithm for double hashing
generatedata.cpp
    to generate the 3 dataset, NOTE: if you use windows, you need to fix the path to absolute path, eg: C:\\data
doublehash
    the appended result for all dataset using doublehash.cpp
linearprobing
    the appended result for all dataset using linearprobing.cpp
name.in
    a dataset list of people word name
data*.in
    a generated dataset in case you can't use generatedata.cpp
checkanswer.cpp
    a file to validate that our output from doublehashing and linearprobing is correct, implemented using C++ stl map
